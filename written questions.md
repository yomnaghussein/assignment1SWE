###1)what is the class?
##### the class is the single most important c++ enhancment for implementing the object-oriented programming features and tying them together & vehicle for translating an abstraction to a user defined type. it combines data representation & method for manipulating that data into one neat package.
###2)how does a class accomplish abstraction, encapsulation & data hiding ?
##### abstraction: process to show only relevant data & hide unnecassary details of an object from the user. encapsulation: process to bind data & functions into single unit called class implementation. class can accomplish this by its new access control keywords "public & private" which describe the access for class members. any program that use an object of particular class can access public portion directly. program can access the private protion by public section of class.
###3)what is the relationship between object and class?
##### the object is an instance of the class for ex. the car would be a class and its engine, tires, body could be its attributes which can be accessed by the objects.
###4)in what way, aside from being functions, are class functions different from data member ?
#####member functions go into the public section & data memory comes into the private section.  member functions have their declaration inside the class definition & works on the data members of the class. if the data member is inside the public section we can access it easily but if it is in the private section we must create special public member function to access it.
###5)Class bankaccount
##### in codes.cpp file
###6)when are the class called? when are the class destructor called?
#####the constructors are called once an object is created.
###8) what is the default constructor? what is the advantage of having one?
#####default constructor is the constructor that is used to create an object when you don't provide explicit intialtizaltion values. it has no parameters or par. with default value.
###10)what are this and *this?
##### pointer that points to the current object can be used to access the members of the current object with the help of the arrow operator.
